# machine-learning-practise and SQL Databases

A comprehensive README file summarizing my completion of the "Using Databases in Python" course from the University of Michigan on Coursera, along with your practice in machine learning using Kaggle data:

# Overview

This repository contains work from the "Using Databases in Python" course by the University of Michigan on Coursera. The course focuses on integrating Python with relational databases, primarily SQLite, and covers SQL queries, database design, and database integration with Python using `sqlite3`. In addition to this course, the repository showcases machine learning practices using real-world datasets from Kaggle after completing the Machine Learning Specialization from Stanford University.

# Courses Completed

1. **Using Databases with Python (University of Michigan)**
   - Focused on database management and integration in Python.
   - Explored the use of SQLite, SQL queries, and connecting Python code to a database for CRUD operations.

2. **Machine Learning Specialization (Stanford University)**
   - Learned about key concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
   - Practical implementation of machine learning models using Python and scikit-learn.
   - Extensive exercises using real-world data from Kaggle to apply machine learning techniques in classification, regression, clustering, and more.

# Project Setup

### Prerequisites
To run the projects in this repository, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **SQLite3** for database work
- **pip** for installing dependencies
- **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib** for machine learning tasks

### Installation
You can install the required Python packages by running:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

The `requirements.txt` includes:

    - sqlite3
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - scikit-learn
    - seaborn

## Database Work (Using Databases in Python)

### Key Learnings
The "Using Databases in Python" course covered the following major concepts:
- **Database Design**: Understanding how to design a relational database schema, normalize data, and avoid redundancy.
- **SQL Queries**: Learning SQL for creating tables, inserting records, selecting data, and performing joins.
- **Python Integration**: Using Pythonâ€™s `sqlite3` module to interact with an SQLite database. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) were performed within Python applications.
- **Advanced SQL**: Introduction to more complex SQL statements such as `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and subqueries.

### SQL Queries and Python Integration
The repository includes sample Python scripts that demonstrate how to:
- Create and connect to an SQLite database.
- Insert, update, and delete records using SQL through Python.
- Perform SQL queries to retrieve meaningful data and process it using Python.

## Machine Learning Practice

### Kaggle Datasets
After completing the Machine Learning Specialization, I applied the techniques learned to real-world data from Kaggle. Examples of datasets used include:
- **Diabetes Dataset**: A classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes.
- **House Prices Dataset**: A regression problem aimed at predicting house prices based on various features.
- **Data manipulation**: Data manipulation techniques and general algorithm functions

### Future Development
- **Deep Learning**: Plan to explore deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
- **Model Deployment**: Integrating models into web applications or APIs for practical use.

## Challenges Faced
- **Data Cleaning**: Many datasets from Kaggle had missing or noisy data. Handling this required significant preprocessing and imputation strategies.

## Future Plans
- Begin deep learning practice and work with **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for more complex problems such as image and speech recognition.
- Explore deployment of models through **Flask** or **FastAPI** for real-world applications.

## Contributions
Feel free to fork this repository and make contributions to improve the database handling scripts or machine learning models. You can:
- Add new models or data preprocessing techniques.
- Suggest improvements for optimizing code and runtime.
- Report any bugs or issues.

To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
